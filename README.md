# painter-game
The goal of the Painter game is to collect three different colors of paint: red, green, and blue. The paint falls from the sky in cans that are kept floating by balloons, and you must make sure each can has the right color before it falls through the bottom of the screen. You can change the color of the paint by shooting a paint ball of the desired color at the falling can. You can select the color that you shoot by using the R, G, and B keys on the keyboard. You can shoot a paint ball by left-clicking in the game screen. By clicking further away from the paint cannon, you give the ball a higher velocity. The place where you click also determines the direction in which the cannon shoots. For each can that lands in the correct bin, you get 10 points. For each wrongly colored can, you lose a life (indicated by the yellow balloons at top left on the screen).
